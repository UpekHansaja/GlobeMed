Answer all questions
Your studies will be governed by the Java Institute Academic Regulations on Assessment,
Progression and Awards.
Students are expected to use reference books, the Internet, journals and other similar sources
in order to accomplish the task specified above.
Students are expected to refrain from repeating any content in their research document.
At the reassessment attempt, the mark is capped and the maximum mark that can be achieved
is 40%.

CHEATING AND PLAGIARISM
Both cheating and plagiarism are totally unacceptable and the Institute maintains a strict policy against
them. It is YOUR responsibility to be aware of this policy and to act accordingly.
The basic principles are:
●
●

●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Don’t pass off anyone else’s work as your own, including coding examples. This is plagiarism and
is viewed extremely seriously by the Institute.
Don’t submit a piece of work in whole or in part that has already been submitted for assessment
elsewhere. This is called duplication and, like plagiarism, is viewed extremely seriously by the
Institute.
Always acknowledge all of the sources that you have used in your assignment or project.
If you are using the exact words of another person, always put them in quotation marks.
Check that you know whether the assignment is to be produced individually or whether you can
work with others.
If you are doing group work, be sure about what you are supposed to do on your own.
Never make up or falsify data to prove your point.
Never allow others to copy your work.
Never lend disks, memory sticks, or copies of your coursework to any other student. in the
Institute. This may lead to you being accused of collusion.

ASSIGNMENT BRIEF:
You are required to complete the following tasks by applying appropriate data structures and algorithms
to the given scenarios. Each task requires a thorough understanding of the concepts and their
application in solving real-world problems.
GlobeMed Healthcare Management System
GlobeMed is a large healthcare organization that operates several hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies
across the country. Currently, the organization struggles with managing patient records, scheduling
appointments, handling billing, and coordinating care across its facilities. The existing systems are
outdated and not well-integrated, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and poor patient experiences.
To address these issues, GlobeMed's management has decided to implement a comprehensive
Healthcare Management System. This system should integrate patient records, appointment
scheduling, billing, and care coordination into a single, efficient platform. The system will need to
support various types of healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, pharmacists) and handle complex
processes such as insurance claims and medical reporting.
The project has been assigned to MediTech Solutions, where you are a senior software engineer
responsible for leading the development team. You are expected to design and implement the system
using appropriate design patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of use.
In this assignment, you will work on six parts. In parts A, B, C, D, E, and F, you will focus on different
components of the system, applying your knowledge of design patterns. Part G and H provides
instructions for the mid-assignment checkpoint for feedback, final presentation and report.

Part A: Patient Record Management (15 marks)
GlobeMed needs a system for managing patient records, including personal details, medical history, and
treatment plans, securely and accessibly for authorized personnel only.
•

Tip: When choosing design patterns for this part, consider data security, privacy, and the need
for authorized data access. Examples: Adapter for data interoperability.

1. Identify the most suitable design pattern for managing secure, accessible patient records.
marks)

(3

2. Analyze how the identified pattern could be used to securely manage and retrieve patient data.
(4 marks)
3. Critically evaluate the benefits of using this design pattern, specifically for data security,
accessibility, and maintainability. (8 marks)

Part B: Appointment Scheduling (15 marks)
Efficient appointment scheduling is necessary for consultations, diagnostics, and surgeries across
GlobeMed facilities. Patients need to book appointments with different healthcare professionals while
the system manages staff schedules.
•

Tip: Look for patterns that support scheduling flexibility and real-time conflict management,
such as Command to encapsulate scheduling requests.

1. Identify the most suitable design pattern for the scheduling functionality. (3 marks)
2. Provide a UML class diagram to demonstrate the selected design pattern’s mechanism. (4
marks)
3. Critically evaluate the pattern's benefits for appointment management, especially in multilocation scenarios. (8 marks)
Part C: Billing and Insurance Claims (15 marks)
GlobeMed needs a flexible, decoupled billing and insurance claims processing system for various
services. This includes consultations, treatments, and medications, and should support billing directly or
through insurance.
•

Tip: Focus on patterns that allow decoupling of billing from claims processing to increase
flexibility, such as the Chain of Responsibility for multi-step claim approvals.

1. Identify the most suitable design pattern for handling billing and insurance claims. (3 marks)
2. Analyze how this pattern enables flexible billing processes in the system. (4 marks)
3. Explain the design pattern’s role in implementing insurance claim processing, especially for
scalability. (8 marks)

Part D: Managing Medical Staff Roles and Permissions (15 marks)
GlobeMed employs a diverse range of medical staff, including doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and
administrative personnel. Each role requires different levels of access to the system and specific
permissions to perform various tasks. Based on this requirement:
i.
ii.
iii.

Identify the most suitable design pattern to manage roles and permissions in the system. (3
marks)
Analyze how the identified design pattern can be used to implement role-based access
control in the system. (4 marks)
Write a sample code snippet demonstrating the application of the design pattern to fulfill
this requirement. (8 marks)

Part E: Generating Medical Reports (15 Marks)
GlobeMed needs to generate various reports, such as patient treatment summaries, diagnostic results,
and financial reports. The system should allow for the separation of report generation logic from core
medical data objects. Based on this requirement:
i.
ii.
iii.

Identify the most suitable design pattern to separate report generation logic from medical
data objects. (3 marks)
Explain how the identified design pattern allows you to extract necessary information and
generate reports. (4 marks)
Critically evaluate the benefits of using the selected design pattern for maintainability and
report flexibility. (8 marks)

Part F: Security Considerations (15 marks)
Healthcare data is sensitive, so the system must enforce robust security for all components. Consider
factors like data encryption, user authentication, and access logging.
1. Identify and justify design patterns for secure data handling across the system (patient records,
billing, etc.). As examples you can use include Decorator for additional data handling layers. (5
marks)
2. Explain how these patterns address specific security risks in healthcare, such as unauthorized
data access or data tampering. (5 marks)
3. Discuss security best practices, like secure coding, encryption, and access control, that
complement these patterns for enhanced protection. (5 marks)

Part G: Mid-Assignment Checkpoint for Feedback (Optional)
Midway through the assignment (suggested time: one week), you may submit initial work for feedback
on any parts completed or in progress. This will help refine your approach and address any challenges
early on.

Part H: VIVA and Documentation (10 Marks)
i.
ii.

iii.

You are expected to develop the Healthcare Management System based on the given
scenario.
You will demonstrate your application in a VIVA session, where you will explain your use of
design patterns, discuss architectural choices, and answer questions related to the design,
functionality, and overall system structure. (5 marks)
You are also expected to create comprehensive documentation, including a UML class
diagram and working code, to illustrate the design and functionality of your application. (5
marks)
